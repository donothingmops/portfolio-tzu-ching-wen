        "An algorithm for extracting features from 3D Point Clouds was specifically engineered for diverse welding objects, facilitating automated feature extraction and the generation of welding paths for a 6-axis welding robot (UR10e). The system was further enhanced with an online feedback loop, enabling real-time path generation for the welding robot. This innovative approach not only optimizes the welding process but also significantly improves the precision and efficiency of robotic welding operations.",
